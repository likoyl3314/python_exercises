    "    EXPLANATION for the above codes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why Adding the while True Loop Makes Sense\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The while True loop is a control mechanism that ensures the program keeps running until valid data is provided by the user. Without it, the program would exit after a single invalid input, which is not ideal in scenarios where valid input is required.\n",
    "    Key Reasons for Using while True:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Validation Loop:\n",
    "        It allows the program to repeatedly prompt the user until the input meets the required conditions.\n",
    "        This makes the program more user-friendly and robust because it doesn't terminate abruptly on invalid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Error Handling:\n",
    "        Users often make mistakes while entering data (e.g., typing numbers in a name field). The loop gives them multiple chances to correct their input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Seamless Flow:\n",
    "        The loop ensures the program only proceeds to the next step when the current input is valid, maintaining logical flow and preventing crashes or incorrect outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Mandatory Input:\n",
    "        For fields like firstName and lastName, valid input is mandatory. The loop ensures these fields are not left blank or filled with invalid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    What is the Use of \"continue\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and start the next iteration immediately. In the context of this program:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    How continue Works Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Validation Failure:\n",
    "        If the user enters invalid data (e.g., a name with numbers), the program prints an error message.\n",
    "        The continue statement ensures the program skips the rest of the code in the loop and goes back to the beginning of the loop to prompt the user again.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Prevents Execution of Subsequent Code:\n",
    "        Without continue, the program might attempt to execute code that depends on valid input, leading to unintended behavior or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why Use \"while True\" and \"continue\" Together?\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Infinite Loop with Controlled Exit:\n",
    "        The while True loop creates an infinite loop, but valid input (or user action) determines when the loop exits using a break.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Error Recovery:\n",
    "        The continue statement allows the program to recover gracefully from invalid input by restarting the loop instead of executing unnecessary or invalid code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Logical Flow:\n",
    "        Combining these two ensures the program enforces strict input validation while maintaining a logical and clean flow.\n",

    "    not firstName.replace(' ', '').alpha():\n",
    "        This checks if the string contains anything other than letters and spaces. This part is fine.\n",

    "            If firstName is valid, the condition evaluates to False because of not.\n",

    "NOTES FOR ABOVE REVISED CODE:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **What is the Use of `continue` in the `get_price()` Function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `get_price()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if price < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Price cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n",
    "    continue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the user enters a negative price, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop and prompts the user again.\n",
    "- Without `continue`, the loop would proceed to the `return` statement, which would end the function and return an invalid value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Difference Between `continue` and `break`**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature       | `continue`                                   | `break`                                   |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Purpose**   | Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. | Exits the loop entirely, stopping further iterations. |\n",
    "| **Use Case**  | When you want to skip certain inputs or conditions but continue looping. | When you want to stop the loop completely because a condition is met. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of `continue`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 2:\n",
    "        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop for i = 2\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of `break`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 2:\n",
    "        break  # Exit the loop when i = 2\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Why Are `price1` and `price2` Handled Separately in the Main Program?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Flexibility and Reusability**\n",
    "The `get_price()` function is designed to be generic and reusable. It asks for a single price and ensures it is valid. Separating the logic into the main program allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call `get_price()` as many times as needed for different items.\n",
    "- Avoid hardcoding specific variables like `price1` and `price2` into the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Separation of Concerns**\n",
    "- **Function Responsibility**: The `get_price()` function is responsible only for validating and returning a single price.\n",
    "- **Main Program Responsibility**: The main program is responsible for combining multiple calls to `get_price()` and handling specific business logic, like summing the prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, a key concept in clean code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Example of Why This Separation Is Useful**\n",
    "If tomorrow you need to calculate prices for 10 items instead of 2, you can reuse `get_price()` without modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    total += get_price(f\"Enter price for item {i}: \")\n",
    "print(f\"The total price for 10 items is ${total:.2f}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `get_price()` was tied to `price1` and `price2`, you would have to rewrite the function to accommodate more items.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Advantages of Separating `get_price()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**:\n",
    "   - The function does one thing: validates and returns a single price.\n",
    "   - The main program handles combining multiple prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - You can easily extend the program to handle more items without modifying the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Readability**:\n",
    "   - Separating the logic makes it easier to understand what each part of the code is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reusability**:\n",
    "   - The `get_price()` function can be reused in other parts of the program or other programs without changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Summary of Design Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use of `continue`**: Ensures the loop skips invalid inputs and prompts the user again.\n",
    "- **Difference Between `continue` and `break`**:\n",
    "  - `continue` skips the current iteration; `break` exits the loop entirely.\n",
    "- **Why Separate `price1` and `price2`?**:\n",
    "  - To keep the `get_price()` function reusable, modular, and focused on validating a single price.\n",
    "  - To follow clean coding principles like the Single Responsibility Principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach makes the program cleaner, easier to extend, and less prone to errors.\n"

    "### Why Use `return` Instead of `print` in Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**:\n",
    "   - A function should focus on a **single responsibility**. \n",
    "   - `greet(name)` is responsible for creating and returning a greeting message. It shouldn't decide how the message is displayed. This separation allows flexibility in how the function's output is used (e.g., logging, displaying, or further processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reusability**:\n",
    "   - By using `return`, the function's output can be used in different contexts:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     message = greet('Michael')\n",
    "     print(message)  # Display to the user\n",
    "     log_to_file(message)  # Save to a log file\n",
    "     send_email(message)  # Use in an email\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - If `print` were used directly in the function, its output would be limited to being displayed on the console, making it less versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testability**:\n",
    "   - Functions that return values are easier to test in automated testing frameworks. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def test_greet():\n",
    "         assert greet('Michael') == 'Hello Michael! How are you?'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - If `print` were used, testing would require capturing printed output, which is less straightforward and less clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clean Code Principles**:\n",
    "   - Functions should do one thing and do it well. Returning a value aligns with the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.\n",
    "   - Printing is a side effect that couples the function to a specific output medium (the console). Clean code avoids unnecessary side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `print` in a Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `print` only in functions specifically designed for user interaction, such as:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def display_greeting():\n",
    "      print(\"Hello, welcome to our application!\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Even in such cases, consider separating the logic (returning a message) from the presentation (printing it).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Defining Functions in Clean Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Meaningful Names**:\n",
    "   - Function names should clearly indicate their purpose.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def generate_greeting(name):  # Clear and descriptive\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single Responsibility**:\n",
    "   - A function should do one thing only.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def calculate_area(radius):  # Only calculates the area\n",
    "         return 3.14 * radius ** 2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Side Effects**:\n",
    "   - Side effects like printing or modifying global variables should be minimized or avoided in general-purpose functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Document the Function**:\n",
    "   - Include a docstring to describe the purpose, parameters, and return value.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def greet(name):\n",
    "         \"\"\"\n",
    "         Generates a greeting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "         Parameters:\n",
    "         name (str): The name of the person to greet.\n",
    "\n",
    "         Returns:\n",
    "         str: A greeting message.\n",
    "         \"\"\"\n",
    "         return f\"Hello {name}!\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Keep It Short**:\n",
    "   - A function should ideally fit within 20-30 lines of code. If it grows larger, consider breaking it into smaller functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:\n",
    "   - Validate inputs and raise meaningful errors when necessary.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def greet(name):\n",
    "         if not isinstance(name, str) or not name.strip():\n",
    "             raise ValueError(\"Name must be a non-empty string.\")\n",
    "         return f\"Hello {name.strip()}!\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Clean Code Version\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Generates a greeting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    name (str): The name of the person to greet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    str: A greeting message.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    if not isinstance(name, str) or not name.strip():\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Name must be a non-empty string.\")\n",
    "    return f\"Hello {name.strip()}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main Program\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    user_name = input(\"What is your name? \").strip()\n",
    "    print(greet(user_name))\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `return` in functions to make them reusable, testable, and clean.\n",
    "- Reserve `print` for user-facing interactions or debugging.\n",
    "- Following clean code principles ensures your code is maintainable, readable, and scalable."
