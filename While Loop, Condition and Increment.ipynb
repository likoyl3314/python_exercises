    "### Code Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line 1:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   talking_with = input('Enter Name... ')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line prompts the user to enter a name.\n",
    "   - The entered name is stored in the variable `talking_with`.\n",
    "   - However, the variable `talking_with` is not used anywhere else in the code, so it has no impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Line 2:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   count = 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This initializes a variable `count` with the value `0`.\n",
    "   - This variable is intended to be used as a counter in the `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Line 3:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while count <= 3:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This is a `while` loop that will execute as long as the condition `count <= 3` is true.\n",
    "   - Since `count` starts at `0`, the loop will execute when `count` is `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Line 4:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "       print('While we were talking...')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, this line prints the message `'While we were talking...'`.\n",
    "   - **Problem:** The `count` variable is never updated inside the loop, so the condition `count <= 3` will always remain true. This creates an **infinite loop**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Line 5:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print('End program')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line is outside the loop and will execute after the loop ends.\n",
    "   - However, because of the infinite loop, this line will never be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues in the Code\n",
    "1. **Infinite Loop:** The `count` variable is not updated inside the loop, so the loop never ends.\n",
    "2. **Unused Variable:** The `talking_with` variable is unused, which makes it redundant.\n",
    "3. **Logic Problem:** The program does not behave as intended because it gets stuck in the infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revised Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a revised version of the code with proper explanations:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Prompt the user to enter a name\n",
    "talking_with = input('Enter Name... ')\n",
    "count = 0  # Initialize the counter\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start a loop that runs 4 times\n",
    "while count <= 3:\n",
    "    print(f'While we were talking with {talking_with}...')  # Use the entered name\n",

    "\n",
    "# After the loop ends\n",
    "print('End program')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Changes\n",
    "1. **Used the `talking_with` Variable:**\n",
    "   - The entered name is now included in the message printed inside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fixed the Infinite Loop:**\n",
    "   - Added `count += 1` inside the loop to increment the counter. This ensures that the loop will eventually end when `count` exceeds `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved User Feedback:**\n",
    "   - The program now includes the name entered by the user in the output to make it more interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Example\n",
    "If the user enters `Alice`, the output will look like this:\n",

    "EXPLANATINO TO THE ABOVE CODE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Great questions! Let me explain step by step why the increment is used, why it ends the loop, and how it differs from using `break`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Why Use the Increment?**\n",
    "The increment (`count += 1`) is used to modify the `count` variable during each iteration of the `while` loop. This ensures that the condition for the loop (`count <= 3`) will eventually become false, allowing the loop to stop naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "- Initially, `count = 0`.\n",
    "- On each iteration, `count` increases by `1`.\n",
    "- After 4 iterations (`count` goes from `0` to `3`), `count` becomes `4`, which no longer satisfies the condition `count <= 3`.\n",
    "- At this point, the loop stops, and the program continues with the next line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common pattern in loops: you use a counter to control how many times the loop runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Why Does It End the Loop?**\n",
    "The `while` loop runs **as long as the condition is true**. When the condition becomes false, the loop exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "- The condition is `count <= 3`.\n",
    "- Each time the loop runs, `count` gets closer to `4`.\n",
    "- Once `count` becomes `4`, the condition `count <= 3` evaluates to `false`, and the loop ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Why Not Use `break` Instead?**\n",
    "You *can* use `break` to exit the loop, but it works differently:\n",
    "- `break` immediately stops the loop, regardless of the condition.\n",
    "- It’s typically used when you want to exit the loop based on a specific event or condition that might not align with the loop's main condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `break` in this scenario would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "talking_with = input('Enter Name... ')\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:  # Infinite loop\n",
    "    print(f'While we were talking with {talking_with}...')\n",
    "    count += 1  # Increment the counter\n",
    "    if count > 3:  # Break the loop when count exceeds 3\n",
    "        break\n",
    "\n",
    "print('End program')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing the Two Approaches:\n",
    "#### Increment Without `break`:\n",
    "- The loop ends naturally when the condition becomes false.\n",
    "- It’s simpler and easier to understand for beginners.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  count = 0\n",
    "  while count <= 3:\n",
    "      print(count)\n",
    "      count += 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `break`:\n",
    "- The loop exits explicitly when a condition is met.\n",
    "- It’s useful for more complex situations where the exit condition isn’t tied to the loop’s main condition.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  while True:\n",
    "      user_input = input('Type \"quit\" to exit: ')\n",
    "      if user_input == \"quit\":\n",
    "          break\n",
    "      print(\"You typed:\", user_input)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which One Should You Use?\n",
    "- **Use the increment approach** when the loop has a clear, predictable ending condition (e.g., counting iterations).\n",
    "- **Use `break`** when the loop’s exit depends on a specific event or condition that might not align with the loop's main condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your original code, the increment is the better choice because it directly ties to the natural termination of the loop (`count <= 3`). Using `break` would be unnecessary complexity in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "1. `#Another exercise` - This is a comment indicating that the following code is part of a different exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `password = ''` - This line initializes an empty string variable named `password`. It will be used to store the user's input.\n",

    "### Key Features of the Enhanced Code\n",
    "1. **Password Complexity Validation:**\n",
    "   - Uses a regular expression (`password_pattern`) to enforce the following rules:\n",
    "     - At least 8 characters long.\n",
    "     - At least 2 uppercase letters.\n",
    "     - At least 1 lowercase letter.\n",
    "     - At least 1 digit.\n",
    "     - At least 1 special character (`@, $, !, %, *, ?, &, #`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feedback for Invalid Passwords:**\n",
    "   - Provides a clear message when the password does not meet the complexity requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Secure Password Storage:**\n",
    "   - The password is hashed using `bcrypt`, and the hashed version is compared to ensure security.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Limited Attempts:**\n",
    "   - Users have a maximum of `MAX_ATTEMPTS` to enter the correct password.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expression Explanation\n",
    "```regex\n",
    "^(?=.*[A-Z].*[A-Z])    # At least 2 uppercase letters\n",
    "(?=.*[a-z])            # At least 1 lowercase letter\n",
    "(?=.*\\d)               # At least 1 digit\n",
    "(?=.*[@$!%*?&#])       # At least 1 special character\n",
    "[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*?&#]{8,}$  # Minimum 8 characters, only allowed characters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(?=.*[A-Z].*[A-Z])`: Ensures there are at least two uppercase letters anywhere in the string.\n",
    "- `(?=.*[a-z])`: Ensures there is at least one lowercase letter.\n",
    "- `(?=.*\\d)`: Ensures there is at least one digit.\n",
    "- `(?=.*[@$!%*?&#])`: Ensures there is at least one special character.\n",
    "- `[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*?&#]{8,}$`: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long and contains only valid characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors to Consider\n",
    "1. **User Experience:**\n",
    "   - Provide clear feedback on why a password is invalid.\n",
    "   - List the complexity requirements to guide users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security:**\n",
    "   - Store passwords as hashed values (e.g., using `bcrypt` or another secure library).\n",
    "   - Avoid storing plain text passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Brute-Force Protection:**\n",
    "   - Limit the number of attempts.\n",
    "   - Consider introducing delays or CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Password Recovery:**\n",
    "   - Provide a secure way for users to reset their password if they forget it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Customizable Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Adjust the complexity requirements based on the security needs of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you’d like further enhancements or explanations!\n"
