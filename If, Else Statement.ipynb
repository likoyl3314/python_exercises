    "EXPLANATION TO THE CODE ABOVE AND DIFFERENCE BETWENN WHILE, IF, IF-ELSE, AND FOR LOOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Let's break down the differences between `while`, `if`, `if-else`, and `for loop` in simple terms, with examples and guidance on when to use each. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`while` Loop**\n",
    "The `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It’s like saying, \"Keep doing this until something changes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 3:  # As long as count is less than 3\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "    count += 1  # Increment count to eventually stop the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use:\n",
    "- When you don't know beforehand how many times the loop should run.\n",
    "- When the loop depends on a condition that may change during execution (e.g., waiting for user input or monitoring a process).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Not to Use:\n",
    "- When you know exactly how many times the loop should run (use a `for` loop instead).\n",
    "- When the condition may never change, causing an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`if` Statement**\n",
    "The `if` statement checks a condition and runs the code inside it only if the condition is true. It’s like saying, \"Do this if this happens.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "if age >= 18:  # If the condition is true\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are eligible to vote.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use:\n",
    "- To make decisions in your program.\n",
    "- When you need to execute a block of code only if a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Not to Use:\n",
    "- When you need to handle multiple possibilities (use `if-else` or `if-elif-else`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`if-else` Statement**\n",
    "The `if-else` statement provides two options: one for when the condition is true, and another for when it’s false. It’s like saying, \"Do this if this happens; otherwise, do that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 16\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are not eligible to vote.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use:\n",
    "- When you need to handle two possible outcomes.\n",
    "- When you want to provide an alternative action if the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Not to Use:\n",
    "- When there are more than two possible outcomes (use `if-elif-else`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **`for` Loop**\n",
    "The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code for a fixed number of times or to go through a collection of items. It’s like saying, \"Do this for every item in this group.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):  # Loop 3 times (0, 1, 2)\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example with a Collection:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n",
    "for name in names:  # Go through each name in the list\n",
    "    print(name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alice\n",
    "Bob\n",
    "Charlie\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use:\n",
    "- When you know exactly how many times the loop should run.\n",
    "- When you want to iterate over a collection of items (e.g., a list or a range).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Not to Use:\n",
    "- When the loop depends on a condition rather than a fixed number of iterations (use a `while` loop).\n",
